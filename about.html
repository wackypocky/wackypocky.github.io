                <p>
                    The Princeton Chamber Music Society was founded with the aim of offering chamber music performance, education, and outreach opportunities to all members of Princeton’s music community. We operate under the belief that every musician should get the chance to play chamber music, regardless of instrument, age, level of experience, or time commitment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, we have a total-acceptance policy: If you want to play chamber music, we’ll match you with groups and opportunities based on interests, time-commitment, and a placement audition. In the spirit of inclusivity and collaboration, we also work with numerous other departments and programs on campus to present mutually enriching interdisciplinary events, bringing together diverse parts of Princeton’s community through a shared love of music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After being placed into a group at the beginning of the semester, or joining PCMS as a pre-formed group, you’ll be informed of concert and outreach opportunities that might be of interest to your group. In addition to more traditional performances, we collaborate each semester with a variety of programs on campus, presenting concerts ranging in theme from German Lieder and French Modernism to English music of the late eighteenth century. PCMS musicians also have the chance to mentor musicians in the Trenton Youth Orchestra through our outreach initiative, and our relationship with the Intercollegiate Chamber Music Festival allows PCMS groups to perform in NYC and participate in masterclasses with musicians from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.
